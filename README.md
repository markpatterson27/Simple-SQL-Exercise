In this exercise, learners/lecturers will write queries that create a database and a simple table in that database. Learners will then test their queries by pushing them to their GitHub repo and checking the output from automated tests.

## Exercise 1

1. Using the `create-database.sql` file, write a query that creates a database called `SimpleDB`.

1. Still using `create-database.sql`, add a query that creates a table in `SimpleDB` called `customers`, that has attributes for customer name and address.
